Producing digital catalogues is a time- and resource-intensive activity. Through this study, we have produced a wealth of data that suggest digital catalogues are a worthwhile endeavor for museums. These publications reach thousands of visitors, are respected for their scholarly merit, and offer significant advantages to users over print publications through the amount of information they make available and the tools they provide for navigating and working with that information. This study has also helped our team identify some of the metrics that work best for measuring the success of digital catalogues. We found that certain metrics of success could be gathered with relative ease using web analytics or close-ended questions on pop-up surveys. In other cases, the rich qualitative data provided through focus group conversations and open-ended survey questions provided deeper insights that require more effort to digest. Conducting this study also highlighted the ways that the definition of success might vary depending on contextual factors and each museum's goals for its digital publications.

## Measuring Reach and Engagement

With careful interpretation, analytics data can provide many quantitative measures of success for digital catalogues, such as the number of visitors a catalogue receives and the depth of their engagement with the catalogue. Even more important is discoverability, since a digital catalogue that does not appear in web searches will not gather any new visitors. In almost all cases, analytics metrics mean little on their own but can take on greater significance when compared to other data, such as:

- A catalogue's performance in a previous time period (e.g., How did the catalogue do in the first month of its launch, versus after a recent marketing push?)

- The performance of a comparable catalogue or resource on the museum's website (e.g., Is the catalogue receiving similar traffic to one featuring a very well-known artist? How does traffic to the museum's collection pages compare to traffic to the catalogue?)

- The reach of a similar print publication (e.g., How many copies did a comparable print publication sell in the first year, and how does this compare to the number of engaged visitors the digital catalogue received in that time period?)

Web analytics that can be used as a basis for making these comparisons include the following:

In comparing analytics data for this study, we found that defining what counts as a catalogue session is open to interpretation and can make a tremendous difference for measuring catalogue reach and engagement. The experience of visiting a single web page within a digital catalogue does not guarantee a visitor's awareness of the catalogue as a whole in the same way they would have if holding a print publication in their hands. We found that the analytics data varied considerably depending on whether we looked at all catalogue sessions or just sessions that included a visit to the catalogue homepage. Museums may therefore want to set some minimum standard for what counts as a catalogue visit. (See [How much traffic are the catalogues receiving?](/marketing-and-demographics/traffic/) for more information.)

## Measuring Usability and Performance

A digital catalogue can only be deemed successful if users are able to navigate it and find content of interest. Usability was therefore one focus of this study. We found that some of the keys to usability success included visitors being able to easily 1) access the table of contents, 2) determine their location within the publication as well as the larger museum website, and 3) find and use tools of interest. Some usability metrics can be tracked through analytics data:

{{< q-figure id="table-08" class="table" >}}

We also found that a simple question on the pop-up survey—"Did you find what you were looking for?"—provided a quick measure of usability. While our focus group homework and discussion questions also collected usability data, we found participants' opinions were highly varied and sometimes contradictory. (See [Functionality and Design](/functionality-and-design/) for the full discussion.) This qualitative data helped us to identify a few key trends and areas in which the catalogues might be improved, but we also discovered it did not help to get bogged down by the comments of a few disgruntled users.

## Measuring Value to Audiences

An important measure of success for this study was the extent to which audiences view these catalogues as trustworthy, scholarly sources. Analytics metrics can provide certain indirect measures of scholarly value by telling us how visitors arrive at the catalogues and how deeply they engage with the content:

{{< q-figure id="table-09" class="table" >}}

While analytics are easily collected, we found survey and focus group feedback indispensable for understanding how visitors are assessing the value of these digital catalogues. Some of the key questions that helped us measure this dimension of catalogue success include the following:

- Please rate this resource on a scale of 1--5 for the following criteria: *informative text*

- Is this resource something you would feel comfortable citing for your work? (response options: yes, no, N/A)

- How do you feel this digital catalogue compares to printed resources you use in your work?

- Are the scholarly essays in these catalogues on par with other kinds of sources you might cite?

Close-ended questions such as the first and second bullet above are useful for providing a quick quantitative assessment of a catalogue's scholarly value, but the conversations generated by open-ended questions in this study (such as bullets three and four) provided valuable insights that can only be gleaned from qualitative data. (See [Scholarly Content](/scholarly-content/) for a full discussion.)

This study also demonstrated that while these catalogues are respected as scholarly resources, they are being used for many purposes beyond scholarly research. They have a strong appeal as teaching resources, and they are also generating large amounts of traffic from art enthusiasts for personal use. (See [Who is using the catalogues?](/marketing-and-demographics/who/) for more information.) Future studies may seek to establish their own metrics for success based on how digital catalogues are serving these additional user groups.
