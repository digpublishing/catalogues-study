## Research Methods


| Method | Instruments | Purpose |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Review of Past Evaluations and Related Literature | | The evaluation team reviewed past evaluation reports on digital catalogues produced by these institutions and others. This review was used to refine research questions and methods for the study and to place our study in the context of what is already known about digital museum catalogues. (See [Background Literature](/literature/).) |
| Interviews with Catalogue Developers and Contributors | [Staff Interview Protocol (PDF)](/downloads/instruments/staff-interview-protocol.pdf) | Group interviews with staff from each of the four museums provided additional context for the study and helped to further hone our research questions and methods. |
| Web Analytics | [Analytics Data (Google Sheet)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JquCc_CQDLMm45XA_cGNaCpi2yZ_Dt2f9VeWEq3WuH8/edit?usp=sharing) | Web analytics provided answers to simple questions about website traffic and usage patterns and suggested avenues for further exploration through surveys and qualitative data collection. |
| Pop-up Survey for Existing Users | [Pop-Up Survey (PDF)](/downloads/instruments/pop-up-survey.pdf) | A brief survey embedded on three of the four museums' websites captured basic information on current users, including occupation, the purpose of their visit, and their success/failure in finding what they are seeking. |
| Email Survey for Potential Users | [Email Survey (PDF)](/downloads/instruments/email-survey.pdf) | A lengthier survey was distributed to potential users in order to gather more in-depth information on the catalogue content, design, and utility for different audiences. This survey asked about participants' occupation and familiarity with digital catalogues, then randomly assigned participants one of the four catalogues to explore. |
| Catalogue Homework and Focus Group Debriefing | [Focus Group Homework (PDF)](/downloads/instruments/focus-group-homework.pdf) \| [Focus Group Discussion Questions (PDF)](/downloads/instruments/focus-group-discussion-questions.pdf) | Twenty-five individuals were recruited to take part in an extended qualitative review of the catalogues, completing a series of homework tasks and then participating in an online focus group to debrief about their experiences. These participants were able compare the design, tools, and content of the various catalogues. They also engaged in a deeper discussion about the purpose of the catalogues and the possibilities that this form of publishing holds. |
