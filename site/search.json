Paul Getty Museum, and the National Gallery of Art, and the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Each of these institutions has forged new ground in museum publishing, taking the traditional print catalogue and reimagining it for an online environment. The catalogues selected for this study were each designed as digital-first, incorporating features to enhance the reading experience such as zoomable images and integration with the museums’ online collection pages. All were developed for a target audience of researchers, defined as content experts, other academic non-specialists, and college-level students. These projects tend to be distinguished from other types of web publications in that they originate from print publishing traditions and are specifically authored, published (and potentially revised) at a specific date, are highly visual, and include scholarly apparatus such as footnotes, bibliographies, and appendices. In undertaking this study, this team of four art institutions sought to answer the following questions:\n Who is using the catalogues? How can the catalogues be marketed effectively to their target audience? Does the design and function of the catalogues meet users’ needs? What content do users desire from these publications? How can museums continue to push the boundaries of online publication?  The team contracted Rockman et al, a consulting and research firm with experience evaluating online environments, to design and carry out this study. Surveys, web analytics, and focus groups were used to collect feedback from both current and potential users of the catalogues.\nCover image: Ferdinand Bol, An Old Man Reading, 1642.
