[{"content":"This report presents findings from a study of scholarly digital catalogues published by the Art Institute of Chicago, the J. Paul Getty Museum, and the National Gallery of Art, and the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Each of these institutions has forged new ground in museum publishing, taking the traditional print catalogue and reimagining it for an online environment. The catalogues selected for this study were each designed as digital-first, incorporating features to enhance the reading experience such as zoomable images and integration with the museums\u0026rsquo; online collection pages. All were developed for a target audience of researchers, defined as content experts, other academic non-specialists, and college-level students. These projects tend to be distinguished from other types of web publications in that they originate from print publishing traditions and are specifically authored, published (and potentially revised) at a specific date, are highly visual, and include scholarly apparatus such as footnotes, bibliographies, and appendices.\nIn undertaking this study, the team sought to build off previous examinations of catalogues like these, such as the final report of the Online Scholarly Catalogue Initiative (OSCI) and evaluations of other individual catalogues. The goals of this study are not only to better understand the current landscape some years later, but also to do so in a comprehensive, cross-institutional manner and with a particular focus on the user. This study aims to answer questions such as:\n Who is using the catalogues? How can the catalogues be marketed effectively to their target audience? Does the design and function of the catalogues meet users’ needs? What content do users desire from these publications? How can museums continue to push the boundaries of online publication?  The team contracted Rockman et al, an education consulting and research firm with experience evaluating online environments, to design and carry out this study. Researchers reviewed background literature on digital catalogues and interviewed museum staff to set the stage for the project. Surveys, web analytics, and focus groups were then used to collect feedback from both current and potential users of the catalogues. The result is a much more thorough understanding of digital catalogues from the user perspective that can help inform future catalogues produced by these museums and others.\nCover image: Ferdinand Bol, An Old Man Reading, 1642.

Roughly half of the users are the target audience of researchers and scholars, but the catalogues are also utilized by artists, art enthusiasts, teachers, museum volunteers, and casual browsers.\n Target audiences are familiar with digital catalogues, and previous concerns about the value or permanence of online resources are fading.\nOur email survey of target audiences shows that 90% have browsed a digital catalogue in the past and 82% have used one in their work or studies. Study participants also expressed comfort citing digital catalogues in their work. Although they still have some concerns about the permanence of digital resources, this would not deter most from utilizing the catalogues.\n Interest in specific artworks and high-quality images are strong drivers of catalogue traffic.\nForty percent of current users surveyed via a pop-up survey said they came to the catalogue to research a particular object, and focus group participants of target audience members indicated similar motivations. Participants were also very concerned with finding high resolution images of artworks and valued image viewing tools above many of the other catalogue features.\n Ensuring the catalogues are findable through academic search engines is critical for driving target audience traffic to the catalogues.\nCurrently, referrals account for only a small percentage of traffic to the catalogues, and participants expressed concern that these types of resources do not appear in their typical searches. Academic search engines provide guidance to publishers that could help museums increase the visibility of their catalogues.\n Users value the scholarship of the catalogues, with only a few reservations.\nParticipants indicated high levels of trust in the museums producing these catalogues and particularly valued the inside information these institutions can provide on object provenance, conservation, and other technical information. Some users suspect that scholarly interpretive essays contained with the catalogues may contain museum biases, but these suspicions could be reduced by calling attention to the peer review process where applicable and to authorship.\n Digital tools can greatly enhance the user experience, provided they are easy to locate.\nParticipants praised tools that expand the content available to them (e.g., access to archive documents or infrared images), organize information in new ways (interactive maps, side-by-side image comparisons), and provide citation guidance. Many participants, however, did not find these tools in a quick exploration of the catalogues, so catalogues must be carefully designed to call attention to these features.\n Users want all the information, but not all at once.\nParticipants like that the digital interface allows museums to share vast quantities of information, but careful organization is required to prevent content overload. Users want to be able to drill down into content that interests them while easily skimming past material that is less relevant.\n Navigation sign posts are key to the user experience.\nMany users do not enter the catalogues through their homepages, and the structures of digital catalogues are complex. Users need clear signals to help them navigate. Links between the catalogues and their parent museum websites are valued but also require indicators to tell users when they are in the catalogue and when they have left.\n PDFs and downloadable images are critical to users.\nWhile study participants were comfortable navigating the catalogues online, they also expressed a strong desire to access PDF versions of catalogue content as well as downloadable images. These features allow users to take notes offline and save images for presentations or research \u0026ndash; tasks that are ubiquitous in the work of the target audience..\n Digital catalogues are valued for their ability to incorporate new information as research advances and for their potential to reach wider audiences.\nParticipants liked that the catalogues could be updated as new scholarship is generated, and expressed the hope that museums would keep information current. Users also deeply appreciate that the catalogues are being offered as open-source publications, putting information in the hands of wider audiences in the U.S. and abroad.\n Users would like to see museums stretch the possibilities of digital publishing.\nParticipants were excited by what the catalogues have accomplished while also envisioning ambitious new directions in terms of catalogue interactivity and connectivity. They requested tools that would allow researchers to add and curate their own information and engage in scholarly dialogue with one another. Users would also like to see museums engage with with each other in an online environment by linking their resources and building tools or publications that cross institutional boundaries.\n  ","id":1,"length":769,"title":"Key Findings","type":"page","url":"https://digpublishing.github.io/catalogues-study/findings/"},{"content":" Art Institute of Chicago The AIC debuted its first digital catalogue, Monet Paintings and Sculpture at the Art Institute of Chicago, in 2014 and has published ten to date. The AIC was a participant in the early Getty-funded Online Scholarly Catalogue Initiative (OSCI) and has developed all of its catalogues on the Drupal-based OSCI toolkit platform. The catalogues selected for this study are all peer-reviewed, entry-based publications featuring curatorial and conservation texts on works in the museum\u0026rsquo;s collection. The OSCI toolkit platform has enabled the use of zoomable images, 360-degree spins, layered and annotated images, videos and RTI interactive images in these catalogues. The publications have been viewed by over 125,000 users since their inception, according to the Google Analytics. The AIC intends to continue publishing collection catalogues digitally, but may need to find a new platform with which to do so in the near future, so the results of this study will inform that next step.\nIncluded in this study:\n Matisse Paintings, Works on Paper, Sculpture, and Textiles at the Art Institute of Chicago\n Monet Paintings and Drawings at the Art Institute of Chicago\n  Philadelphia Museum of Art The PMA released its first online catalogue, The John G. Johnson Collection: A History and Selected Works, in 2018. It was informed by benchmarking of previous OSCI projects as well as user surveys of the target audience, and by formative evaluation (user testing) during its development. It is integrated into the museum\u0026rsquo;s website, drawing some data via an API from The Museum System (TMS) collections database. It also integrates digitized archival materials from the museum\u0026rsquo;s Library and Archives. It published just one small portion of a larger collection, and the intention is to continue to add content to the publication over time; it is also intended to be a model for scholarly digital publications on other parts of the museum\u0026rsquo;s collections.\nIncluded in this study:\n The John G. Johnson Collection: A History and Selected Works  J. Paul Getty Museum The Getty has published five digital catalogues since 2016, with four more slated for production in the coming years. They use a multiformat publishing tool called Quire that they are currently developing to use internally and hope to also release as open source software. Some of the central lessons from OSCI were around the need for discoverability and longevity of online publications. Quire is meant to address those challenges head on. It is centered around a static site generator called Hugo and outputs a website, ebook, and pdf versions of the publication from a common set of plain-text source files. The multiple formats allow for both a greater distribution and a hedge against loss. Additionally, the website is such that it requires no special server setup to host, and no ongoing maintenance or updating to keep running. Of the Quire books the Getty has published so far or has forthcoming, many are collection catalogues, though Quire also supports the publication of collected volumes, scholarly monographs and other types of publications.\nIncluded in this study:\n Roman Mosaics in the J. Paul Getty Museum  National Gallery of Art The National Gallery of Art launched its Online Editions (OE) platform in 2014 as part of OSCI. To date, six OE collection catalogues have been published in full or incremental releases. OE catalogues exclusively address permanent collection objects and are integrated in the NGA\u0026rsquo;s main online collection pages. As is the case for all collection object pages, certain data fields are populated dynamically from TMS through an API. Static content specific to the OE, including the object entry essays and technical summaries, is housed in Adobe Experience Manager (AEM), the Gallery\u0026rsquo;s web CMS. Search capabilities parallel the broader collection search tools available on the NGA\u0026rsquo;s website, and new functionality developed for the collection pages is automatically integrated into existing OE catalogues. The first five OE catalogues focused on paintings; the 2019 launch of the Alfred Stieglitz Key Set expanded the OEs to the NGA\u0026rsquo;s photography collection and required extensive customization of the platform to accommodate the different demands of the corpus.\nIncluded in this study:\n Dutch Paintings of the Seventeenth Century  See Background Literature for an overview of findings from past evaluations of museum digital catalogues.\n","id":2,"length":700,"title":"About the Digital Catalogues","type":"page","url":"https://digpublishing.github.io/catalogues-study/catalogues/"},{"content":"Prior to developing new methods for this study, REA researchers reviewed the existing literature on digital catalogues, including usability studies, formative and summative evaluations of catalogues, reviews of the catalogues, and the final report produced by the Getty\u0026rsquo;s Online Scholarly Catalogue Initiative (OSCI).1 This literature review provided important context for embarking on a new evaluation of digital catalogues.\nThe OSCI final report provides a valuable overview of the challenges and lessons learned by the J. Paul Getty Museum plus nine other museums funded by the Getty Foundation to create some of the first digital catalogues. The report summarizes key insights about the catalogue creation process and provides an overview of three technology approaches for organizing and publishing catalogue content. A similar production-side perspective on the NGA\u0026rsquo;s Dutch Paintings catalogue is presented in Henel\u0026rsquo;s 2017 article for Visual Arts Research2 and in a user study/design report generated by consulting firm Design for Context to aid the development of the PMA\u0026rsquo;s Johnson catalogue.3 Understanding how digital catalogues are produced and some of the technological workings behind the scenes is helpful for interpreting the end product that users interact with.\nDigital catalogue production is a highly iterative process that brings together multiple museum departments in ongoing conversations. Content, design, and technology all must be considered together. To achieve this, museum staff of different specialties collaborate more closely than they might in the production of a print catalogue. From a technological standpoint, digital catalogue production requires museums to weave together raw collections data using a technology platform (such as the OSCI Toolkit or eMuseum) and present this via the museums\u0026rsquo; websites. The technological platform chosen influences the look and functionality of the final catalogue, as well as the ways it interacts with the parent website. In terms of cost, the upfront investment for a museum\u0026rsquo;s first digital catalogue may be considerable, but once the technology interface, staff responsibilities, and work flow are established, subsequent catalogues can be produced for significantly less. While most catalogue users are unaware of all the moving pieces behind the scenes, reviewing this information helped the evaluation team understand the various influences on the final design and content. The NGA\u0026rsquo;s catalogues, for example, utilize museum collection pages from the larger parent website as art entries pages in the catalogue, with significant effects on catalogue traffic. (See here for more information on this catalogue structure and its implications.) Having this type of background knowledge on the catalogues was also helpful for considering study participants\u0026rsquo; suggestions for catalogue features and the constraints that might act on these.\nThe OSCI final report and other catalogue literature also provide important information on catalogue users, the area that this report seeks to expand. Reviewing these resources allows us to look at how the catalogues have been received in the past and whether opinions are changing with time. Many findings from past studies have remained consistent:\n Users expect much more than a digitized version of a print catalogue. They want digital publications to use technology tools to transform the user experience in dynamic ways.\n Digital catalogues are respected as scholarly sources when they are associated with trusted institutions and when they follow established conventions such as peer review and proper citation format. Users also want to see authors\u0026rsquo; names and access footnotes easily.\n Users care greatly about being able to download content for offline use.\n Interest in the catalogues is driven largely by interest in specific artworks, and use focuses heavily on the images provided.\n A large percentage of visitors are also using the catalogues for teaching material.\n Search engine optimization (SEO) and listing in academic databases are key to increasing the visibility of digital catalogues and helping them to take their place among other scholarly resources.\n  These themes are echoed in our own findings from this user study. Other user opinions, however, appear to have changed with time. An evaluation of digital catalogues by SFMOMA and the Walker Art Center in 20164 and a 2017 review5 of the NGA\u0026rsquo;s Italian Paintings of the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Centuries both focus on users\u0026rsquo; concerns regarding digital catalogue permanence and hesitations users have in citing online materials. Our study found, however, that users have little hesitation about citing digital works and accept that digital resources will change over time. They are still interested in permanence but have found solace in the fact that some museums offer archived versions of the catalogues and permanent links to content.\nUser ideas about catalogue design are also likely to continue changing as aesthetics and conventions change. The book-like design of the AIC catalogues once appealed to scholars who wanted reassurance that digital catalogue content was of the same caliber as printed catalogue content. We found that few users still prefer this format. In another example, minimalist web design has become increasingly popular in recent years, but not all users are in tune with its methods which sometimes hide or reduce navigation elements to ensure a cleaner screen.\nFinally, some bigger picture questions raised in catalogue reviews were used to spark dialogue in our focus group discussions.6,7 What collections and objects should be singled out for inclusion in digital catalogues? What kinds of scholarly content do readers expect and want from digital catalogues? What are the implications of a catalogue that can be updated as ideas and information change?

Research Methods    Method Purpose     Review of Past Evaluations and Related Literature The evaluation team reviewed past evaluation reports on digital catalogues produced by these institutions and others. This review was used to refine research questions and methods for the study and to place our study in the context of what is already known about digital museum catalogues. Background Literature   Interviews with Catalogue Developers and Contributors Group interviews with staff from each of the four museums provided additional context for the study and helped to further hone our research questions and methods. Interview Protocol   Web Analytics Web analytics provided answers to simple questions about website traffic and usage patterns and suggested avenues for further exploration through surveys and qualitative data collection. Analytics data collected   Pop-up Survey for Existing Users A brief survey embedded on three of the four museums\u0026rsquo; websites captured basic information on current users, including occupation, the purpose of their visit, and their success/failure in finding what they are seeking. Survey Instrument   Email Survey for Potential Users A lengthier survey was distributed to potential users in order to gather more in-depth information on the catalogue content, design, and utility for different audiences. This survey asked about participants\u0026rsquo; occupation and familiarity with digital catalogues, then randomly assigned participants one of the four catalogues to explore. Survey Instrument   Catalogue Homework and Focus Group Debriefing Twenty-five individuals were recruited to take part in an extended qualitative review of the catalogues, completing a series of homework tasks and then participating in an online focus group to debrief about their experience. These participants were able to make comparisons of the design, tools, and content of the various catalogues. They also engaged in a deeper discussion about the purpose of the catalogues and the possibilities that this form of publishing holds.

Each museum chose one catalogue to focus on for the analytics review, and analytic metrics for these four catalogues were compiled and compared, looking at overall traffic during a one-year period. (For more on the analytics study, see Methods in Depth.)\nWithin the same one-year time frame, the four catalogues experienced widely different levels of activity when looking at the total number of recorded sessions. The NGA’s Dutch Paintings catalogue logged over 130,000 sessions, compared to roughly 3,000 for the PMA’s catalogue on the Johnson collection.\n        Although this discrepancy may suggest that the NGA catalogue was exponentially more popular than the others, the data should be interpreted with caution. The structure of the individual catalogues and their relationship to their respective museums’ websites has a large potential impact on the analytics collected. Artwork entries in the NGA’s digital catalogues are actually pages within the museum’s online collection pages, so any traffic generated by these collections pages is also tracked as catalogue traffic. Artwork entries for the other catalogues, in contrast, stand independent of their museums’ online collections pages. (For more information, see Deeper Insights - The Unique Structure of the NGA’s Online Editions)\nTo get a better sense of traffic by users who might be aware they are viewing a digital catalogue (as opposed to users who might touch briefly on a single artwork entry while browsing the larger museum website), we also looked at user sessions that included a visit to the catalogues’ homepages. Here the analytics data shows greater consistency across catalogues, although the NGA’s session count still exceeds the others.\n        Sessions that include a visit to the catalogue’s homepage also show deeper levels of engagement by users, as measured by the duration of their visit and the number of pages viewed (see What is the depth and breadth of a typical use session?). Focusing on sessions that hit upon the catalogues’ homepages may therefore be one way to filter out some of the analytics “noise” and narrow in on a target audience with a deeper interest in the catalogues’ content.\n","id":6,"length":360,"title":"How much traffic are the catalogues receiving?","type":"page","url":"https://digpublishing.github.io/catalogues-study/marketing-and-demographics/traffic/"},{"content":"Data from the pop-up survey and web analytics suggest the catalogues are reaching a wide audience, and not just the target audience for whom they were designed. The intended audience for the catalogues includes scholars, curators, professors, and others with a professional interest in art history. While this audience accounts for some of the online traffic to these catalogues, a surprising number of survey respondents did not fit within these categories.\n (participants could select more than one)     (participants could select more than one)    In fact, after recoding occupation data into target/non-target groups, only about half of the survey respondents selected or wrote in a profession that aligns with the target audience for the catalogues. The remaining half included teachers at the K-12 level, artists, and many who simply identified as an art enthusiast in their write-in responses. Target audiences seem to be visiting the AIC catalogues in higher percentages than the NGA catalogues. The integration of NGA\u0026rsquo;s catalogues with the larger museum website may be one reason for the more diverse user base.\nDigital Catalogue Target Audiences (as defined for this study) \n Scholars/researchers Museum professionals and volunteers Professors Graduate and undergraduate students Librarians/archivists Journal editors           The pop-up survey also allowed visitors to identify as a visitor to the museum whose catalogue they were viewing, a member of that museum, or a staff member. Ten percent of the catalogue\u0026rsquo;s users identified as staff, which may be lower than actual percentages if staff tend to ignore the pop-up survey (a scenario that seems likely). The catalogues therefore seem to have important value internally to the museums as well as externally.\nA third of the pop-up survey participants identified as visitors to that institution or members. The remaining 57% did not have any specific affiliation with the museum. The catalogues therefore seem to be used by a wide variety of visitors, including those who might have in-person experience with the collections and those who might only encounter them online. (See an institutional breakdown of museum affiliation in Deeper Insights.)\n        Data from the web analytics review suggests the ages of users is also varied. A common concern for digital publications is that older generations will eschew them in favor of traditional print resources. Millennials, roughly defined as those age 34 and under, do account for a large percentage of visitors to the catalogues, but not so great a portion that older generations are not well-represented.\n (AIC’s Monet catalogue is not currently collecting demographic analytics)     (AIC’s Monet catalogue is not currently collecting demographic analytics)    Finally, catalogue users are more likely to be new visitors than returning visitors. The NGA\u0026rsquo;s Dutch Paintings catalogue receives the highest percentage of returning visitors, at 33%, and the Getty\u0026rsquo;s Roman Mosaics catalogue follows closely behind.\n        Return visitation is a difficult metric to interpret, because it can encompass a wide range of behaviors. Returning users might be interpreted as visitors with a sustained interest in the catalogue \u0026ndash; for example, a scholar referring back to it repeatedly over the course of research project or a professor who frequently uses a catalogue to source images for lectures. It\u0026rsquo;s not possible to tell, however, whether a user is returning for the second time or the hundredth time. While museums might like to see people returning frequently to their catalogues, new visitors are also desirable and indicate that the catalogues are reaching new audiences.\n","id":7,"length":560,"title":"Who is using the catalogues?","type":"page","url":"https://digpublishing.github.io/catalogues-study/marketing-and-demographics/who/"},{"content":"A key question for the team was whether users come to the catalogues because they are interested in the overall topic of the catalogue (e.g., Matisse, 17th century Dutch painting) or if they are more likely to end up in the catalogues in their search for information on specific artworks. The pop-up survey shows that the latter is the stronger driving force, accounting for 40% of participants. Only 8% of participants said their visit was driven by a topic interest.\n (participants could select more than one)     (participants could select more than one)    Additionally, a handful of participants said they were looking for high quality images, even if not searching for a specific piece. This finding corresponds with our focus group discussions, where most participants talked about their interest in specific pieces being the primary reason they might turn to a digital catalogue:\n I really go with a pinpointed reason why I’m looking up an entry on an artwork - when I want to really look for a comparative image that I’m working on. I want to have that possibility to zoom in and really look closely to make comparisons with the images. So I think I use it in a very kind of flexible, fluid kind of research. And I know it’s immediate, it’s accessible, it’s right there. And that’s one of the things that I love about using them.\n (For more information, see Scholarly Content.) That being said, one focus group participant commented that she usually turns to museum catalogues to investigate a specific artwork, which might then lead her to viewing other content in the publication:\n So when I go to print catalogs, I’m looking for what’s been written most recently about a certain work of art. And also their bibliography that goes along with it so I can get the most up to date info that I can. I can imagine using digital catalogs much in the same way. And then letting the individual images that I’m looking for kind of lead me to the rest of the content.\n Pop-up survey participants also wrote-in additional reasons for visiting the catalogues, such as planning a visit to the museum, following up after a visit to the museum, and interest in digital catalogues as a resource (including several individuals who arrived at the catalogues via links from the OSCI Final Report).\nThirteen percent of the pop-up survey participants said they came to the catalogues seeking information for teaching purposes, and this aligned with focus group discussions as well. When asked how they could picture using the catalogues for their work, focus group participants repeatedly talked about teaching with the catalogues, and in a variety of ways:\n I would use these as, as a teaching resource for sure\u0026hellip; I felt that the scholarly content from some of them was really great and would be really appropriate for Masters and PhD level students.\n \n I\u0026rsquo;ve also coincidentally assigned an Art Institute catalogue for reading for students, both for their own class work, but also kind of as a model of what a good resource is.\n \n \u0026hellip;I think a lot as somebody who teaches. Part of it is just grabbing images. Do you have big images I can grab immediately for a PowerPoint?\n \n The writers of the catalogue\u0026hellip; make an argument in the way that a scholar makes an argument. And so for getting students into making arguments to understanding how art historians work, those two catalogues [NGA and PMA] were on par with art history scholarship.\n The catalogues therefore hold special value for teachers and professors by providing high quality images for presentations, readings that can be assigned to students, and examples of how to build scholarly arguments about artworks. One professor also said she likes to have her students critique digital humanities materials, and the catalogues could be used for this purpose as well.\n","id":8,"length":643,"title":"Why do users visit the catalogues?","type":"page","url":"https://digpublishing.github.io/catalogues-study/marketing-and-demographics/why/"},{"content":"Analytics data collected across four catalogues (one from each institution) shows that the vast majority of visitors found the source through an organic search or direct access. The balance of these two sources, however, varied greatly by institution. The high percentage of direct traffic to the PMA catalogue may be due internal staff dominating use of the catalogue in the early months after its launch, but IP address filters would have to be added to determine if this is in fact the case.\n        Google Analytics tags a traffic source as \u0026ldquo;direct\u0026rdquo; when the user\u0026rsquo;s browser doesn\u0026rsquo;t record any referral information on the session. This could mean the user typed the catalogue url directly into their browser or used a bookmark to access the site. In this case, the user visiting the catalogue is already aware of its existence. However, untagged links from emails, documents (such as PDFs), and mobile apps are also categorized as direct traffic by Google Analytics, which can make this category difficult to interpret. Ensuring that email marketing campaigns use UTM codes to tag links is one way to remove some of the confusion from direct traffic.\nGoogle Analytics tags a traffic source as \u0026ldquo;organic search\u0026rdquo; when a user arrived after using a search engine such as Google or Bing. These users may be arriving at the digital catalogues after conducting a search for an artwork or other topic of interest.\nReferrals (links to the catalogue posted elsewhere online) made up a smaller percentage of site traffic for the catalogues and is one indicator of the \u0026ldquo;buzz\u0026rdquo; about the catalogues on the internet or the success of various marketing efforts. Links to the catalogues from library databases also show up as referrals, although this is not a strong driver of traffic at the moment (see How can the catalogues be marketed more effectively?). Those who accessed the catalogues by referrals were directed from a diverse range of sources. For the Dutch Paintings catalogue, the greatest referral source was connexus.com, an education management system. The Johnson catalogue\u0026rsquo;s biggest referrer is Digital Public Library of America, a database of digital resources available on the web. Referral visitors to the Monet catalogue came most often from Guide Labreuche, followed closely by Google Arts \u0026amp; Culture. The Roman Mosaics catalogue\u0026rsquo;s largest referrer is the Getty\u0026rsquo;s own website.\n         Knowing which sites are posting links to the catalogues can help these four institutions as well as others generate ideas of where to promote the catalogues. (A list of the top 10 referrers for the catalogues can be found in Deeper Insights \u0026ndash; Top Referrers.) Internal promotion can also help drive traffic, as the Getty\u0026rsquo;s data shows and as one focus group participant mentioned as well.\n","id":9,"length":452,"title":"How are users finding the catalogues?","type":"page","url":"https://digpublishing.github.io/catalogues-study/marketing-and-demographics/finding/"},{"content":"A general concern among study participants was that digital catalogues are not easy to find using their typical research habits:\n I find that these catalogs often don\u0026rsquo;t come up in Google searches. And so if you don\u0026rsquo;t know it exists, you\u0026rsquo;re not going to find it and you\u0026rsquo;re not going to know it\u0026rsquo;s there as a resource.\n \n I think if it\u0026rsquo;s not something you can get to through a library database or another\u0026hellip; journal database or something like that, it\u0026rsquo;s probably not going to like enter my regular scholarly resources.\n When asked how they typically conduct their research, focus group participants frequently mentioned Google Scholar and the library databases of their home institutions. One focus group participant who is a librarian for an art institution said that from her perspective, these digital catalogues were easier to locate than their print equivalents:\n I see the digital content and the format scheme very promising for discovery\u0026hellip; We have a Primo discovery layer that can find these kinds of publications and with more granularity than it would be with any sort of printed catalog. And I think also just for reference in general and provenance research and so on, this material is just from my point of view, much more easy to discover and use.\n If users discover the catalogues via links from academic search engines or library databases, we would expect these to show up as referral traffic in Google Analytics. At the moment, however, the catalogues are not widely listed and show little traffic from sites such as Google Scholar and JSTOR. These sites provided guidance to publishers who would like their articles indexed, and adhering to their guidelines is one way museums could increase the visibility of their digital publications.1,2\n Catalogue Presence in Academic Search Engines   Listing status - # of referred sessions   Google ScholarWorldCatCrossRefJSTOR     Monet (AIC) ✓ — 5 referred ✓ — 0 referred sessions X X   Roman Mosaics (Getty) X ✓ — 0 referred sessions X X   Dutch Paintings (NGA) X ✓ — 0 referred sessions X X   Johnson Collection (PMA) X ✓ — 13 referred sessions ✓ — 0 referred sessions X     X no listing, but catalogue may be referenced tangentially (e.g., via a specific artwork or citation by another source) ✓ listed with link to catalogue      Catalogue Presence in Academic Search Engines   Listing status - # of referred sessions   Google ScholarWorldCatCrossRefJSTOR     Monet (AIC) ✓ — 5 referred ✓ — 0 referred sessions X X   Roman Mosaics (Getty) X ✓ — 0 referred sessions X X   Dutch Paintings (NGA) X ✓ — 0 referred sessions X X   Johnson Collection (PMA) X ✓ — 13 referred sessions ✓ — 0 referred sessions X     X no listing, but catalogue may be referenced tangentially (e.g., via a specific artwork or citation by another source) ✓ listed with link to catalogue        One librarian focus group participant mentioned Primo as a tool that might give her patrons access to the catalogues. Primo is a discovery service for libraries that provides patrons access to a wide range of resources. It is particularly suited to discovering digital content and allowing users to drill down to specific information of interest. In order to meet their target audiences where they are conducting research, museums producing digital catalogues should look into academic search engine optimization (ASEO) to increase the findability of their online publications in these databases.\nAnother focus group participant expressed a wish for a \u0026ldquo;central clearinghouse\u0026rdquo; specifically focused on online catalogues and other digital humanities projects. Other participants echoed this sentiment. One noted that he was unlikely to search through a museum website to find this kind of publication, so having it listed in a clearinghouse was preferable. Another participant agreed:\n I will say even when I specifically know that there is a catalogue I am looking for, it usually takes me about 15-30 minutes to get through the museums website to even find something that I know exists somewhere.\n Marketing through organizations that serve the catalogues\u0026rsquo; target audience is another option for promoting the catalogues. A conservator who participated in the study listed the Bibliographic Database of the Conservation Information Network (BCIN) and the library of the International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property (ICCROM) as two key sites for locating relevant publications.\nSelf-promotion is another important tactic. One individual who works in digital content for a major art museum said one of their tactics is to constantly share snippets of their catalogues via social media. Doing so can prevent catalogues from being forgotten after the initial marketing buzz has died down:\n At [our museum] we have some online digital publications as well. And one of the things we do is constantly share that content. Like we dig up deep stuff from within it and share it on social media because we know that there was an initial push when we launched, and we sent out a press release and there were articles. But then people forget about it and you have to continually remind people.\n Museums might even consider generating their own lists or repositories to help cross promote their digital publications. The Getty\u0026rsquo;s own Abstracts of International Conservation Literature (AATA) was listed by one focus group participant as a go-to location for conducting his conservation research.\nAnother possibility for reaching wider audiences is promoting the catalogues through sites that reach beyond academics and researchers. One focus group participant with an eye on digital humanities commented:\n I personally only ever find these catalogues when they get listed on sites like Colossal or Hyperallergic or some of the others like Open Culture - websites that do a really good job of letting the general public know that these digitized collections have suddenly been released.\n Colossal and Hyperallergic are online arts and culture magazines. Open Culture is a repository for free educational media, including ebooks. Each of these could be a place to promote the digital catalogues, placing them in front of the eyes of those who are closely following digital humanities but also those with a general interest in what\u0026rsquo;s new in arts and culture.\nNotes \n \u0026ldquo;Publisher Support.\u0026rdquo; Google Scholar Support for Publishers.

The four digital catalogues reviewed in the email survey have distinct designs, and one of the first questions for participants was if first glimpses of the catalogues\u0026rsquo; homepages clearly conveyed the type of resource they were viewing. A strong majority of participants described the catalogues as \u0026ldquo;scholarly/academic resources\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;educational resources.\u0026rdquo;\n (participants could select more than one)     (participants could select more than one)    At first glance, participants were more likely to describe the catalogues as \u0026ldquo;web pages\u0026rdquo; than \u0026ldquo;publications\u0026rdquo; which may say something about the perceived formality of these resources.\nThe AIC\u0026rsquo;s Matisse catalogue is intentionally designed to resemble a book, and participants were therefore more likely to describe it as an \u0026ldquo;ebook\u0026rdquo; in their survey responses. The NGA\u0026rsquo;s catalogue, in contrast, was more likely than the others to be described as a \u0026ldquo;web page.\u0026rdquo; Both of these findings align with focus group responses. Participants talked about the Matisse catalogue resembling a more static resource, similar to a book. Several also described the NGA homepage as \u0026ldquo;old school web\u0026rdquo; with its three-column layout and the large amount of information packed into the homepage.\n                 ","id":13,"length":210,"title":"What are users’ first impressions of the catalogues?","type":"page","url":"https://digpublishing.github.io/catalogues-study/functionality-and-design/first-impressions/"},{"content":" Our study found that participants using these catalogues typically can find what they are looking for and with relative ease, but that there is also room for improvement. Seventy percent of pop-up survey respondents said they easily found what they needed in the catalogues, and another 22% found what they were seeking with more effort. Only 8% of respondents said they couldn\u0026rsquo;t find what they needed.\n        Unfortunately, those individuals who failed in their search didn\u0026rsquo;t often leave feedback on what they had been seeking, but the few who did (n=11) were generally looking for artworks they had seen in the past but did not know the title of.\nThe catalogues\u0026rsquo; layout and navigation also received fairly positive ratings at the end of the email survey, with no significant differences between the four catalogues.\n        The fact that all four catalogues received similar scores for clarity of layout and ease of navigation suggests that although individuals might have varying preferences, on the whole users can adapt to quite different formats. (For individual catalogue scores, see Deeper Insights.)\nWhen asked to comment on the catalogues\u0026rsquo; structure and navigation, several themes emerged from the responses of our focus group participants:\nBook-like navigation can feel constricting in a web environment. The AIC\u0026rsquo;s Matisse catalogue gives users two options for navigation: 1) turning the catalogue page by page using arrow buttons, and 2) a Table of Contents sidebar that can be collapsed or expanded. Some participants relied on the arrows to turn the pages, which became cumbersome and didn\u0026rsquo;t give the readers a sense of where they were at within the catalogue. The analytics data also shows evidence of this, in that pages earlier in the catalogue are receiving higher amounts of traffic. (See a list of top pages viewed under Deeper Insights.) Even when readers were aware of the Table of Contents, they couldn\u0026rsquo;t shake the feeling that the catalogue was imposing a linear direction on their reading:\n I felt like there was no opportunity for me to explore the publication as I wanted as a reader. Instead, I felt pushed into selecting the side arrows to move sequentially and progressively through the publication. For me, this feels contrary to what the digital format should be.\n \n I think what struck me\u0026hellip;as I was sort of doing the homework was how much I value the flexibility of how I want to move through these publications. And that with the Matisse one in particular, I felt right away, very constricted that I sort of had to move in the way that they directed me in this sequential progressive way.\n This sentiment arose several times in the focus group discussions. Overall, participants expressed the desire to jump from place to place as their interest dictates and felt the layout of the Matisse catalogue hindered this.\nKeep navigation tools obvious and well-labeled. Focus group participants generally seemed to prefer that the catalogues use more labels, even if it means occasionally sacrificing clean design. Not everyone noticed the \u0026ldquo;breadcrumb\u0026rdquo; provided in the NGA catalogue for navigating back to the homepage. Those who found it appreciated it, and those who did not complained about having to use the back arrow on their browsers.\n Navigational breadcrumb in NGA’s Dutch Paintings catalogue     Navigational breadcrumb in NGA’s Dutch Paintings catalogue    Likewise, the \u0026ldquo;hamburger menu\u0026rdquo; (three small horizontal lines) that lead users to the \u0026ldquo;Contents\u0026rdquo; page of the Roman Mosaics catalogue were too discreet for the taste of many users.\n “Contents” button on Roman Mosaics homepage     “Contents” button on Roman Mosaics homepage    Precise navigation is appreciated. When users want to navigate back to where they were previously in a publication, they want to be able to return to the precise spot on the page. This is an advantage of the NGA\u0026rsquo;s Dutch Paintings catalogue as pointed out by one focus group participant. The back button on users\u0026rsquo; browsers returns them to the same spot on the page they had been viewing previously, rather than returning them to the top of the page in which case users would have to scroll down to find their place.\nHomepage design can have a big influence on navigation. Email survey participants were asked what they would look for first when visiting a digital catalogue and where they would click to find it, and the resulting heatmaps are telling. The clean design of the Monet catalogue homepage means that visitors will be funneled in a limited number of directions. The Getty\u0026rsquo;s page is longer, but still has limited entry points via bold, obvious buttons. The NGA\u0026rsquo;s homepage has many links to lead users into the catalogue without a suggested hierarchy, and the heatmap shows that users are likely to click any number of places. The PMA\u0026rsquo;s homepage is the longest and also has many potential entry points, but users are drawn most to the \u0026ldquo;Read More\u0026rdquo; button highlighted in red text, which will lead them into an introductory essay on the collection. A smaller percentage of users selected the \u0026ldquo;Publication Contents\u0026rdquo; link, which is less noticeable in black and white. Catalogue designers can therefore influence whether users will begin browsing a digital catalogue from the \u0026ldquo;front,\u0026rdquo; refer quickly to a contents page, or dive directly into artwork entries and essays based on the layout of the homepage. Each may have pros and cons for the user experience, but designers must consider how to help users quickly get their bearings if they suddenly find themselves deep in content and seeking a way back.\n    Heatmap of Monet Paintings and Drawings at the Art Institute of Chicago homepage indicating where users are inclined to click first         Heatmap of Roman Mosaics in the J. Paul Getty Museum homepage indicating where users are inclined to click first          Heatmap of Dutch Paintings of the 17th Century homepage indicating where users are inclined to click first         Heatmap of The Johnson G. Johnson Collection: A History and Selected Works homepage indicating where users are inclined to click first       Paths between digital catalogues and their parent museum websites are useful and must be clearly marked. Our study participants appreciated when each art museum provided links between digital catalogue content and additional content on the host institutions\u0026rsquo; webpages, but these connections were also occasionally a source of confusion. The Getty, NGA, and PMA catalogues all provide links between the catalogue and their museums\u0026rsquo; collections pages. In the Getty and PMA catalogues, the collections pages open in a new tab on the user\u0026rsquo;s browser. In the NGA catalogue, artwork entry pages are one and the same with the museum\u0026rsquo;s collections pages. For all three of these catalogues, users had some difficulty distinguishing when they were within the catalogue and when they had left. If they knew they had left, they weren\u0026rsquo;t always certain how to get back to the catalogue content:\n One issue I found with some of them was when they did link to the larger collection, it sort of just dropped you into their main website and you couldn\u0026rsquo;t find your way back.\n Allowing easy passage between collections pages and the catalogues, however, is one way to drive additional traffic to the catalogues. Researchers investigating an object might be unaware of a catalogue\u0026rsquo;s existence until they are linked to it through a museum\u0026rsquo;s collections pages. Maintaining these connections but also clearly demarcating the boundaries of collection/catalogue is therefore a challenge for the catalogues. Ensuring that links between the two open in new tabs may be one way to signal to users when they have left one resource and entered another.\n(For further discussion of how the NGA\u0026rsquo;s catalogue structure affects the visitor experience and catalogue traffic, see Deeper Insights - The Unique Structure of the NGA\u0026rsquo;s Online Editions.)\n","id":14,"length":1279,"title":"Do users understand how to navigate the catalogues and find content of interest?","type":"page","url":"https://digpublishing.github.io/catalogues-study/functionality-and-design/navigation/"},{"content":" An obvious advantages of digital catalogues over their print counterparts are the variety of technological tools that can be built into the interface that allow users to interact beyond just reading text and looking at static images. These digital catalogues have a range of features designed to enrich the user experience, including but not limited to: special citation generators, zoomable images, sculptures that can rotated 360°, audio/video content, and side-by-side image comparison tools. Each of these special features takes considerable time and energy to create, so the team asked, \u0026ldquo;Do users find these tools helpful? Are they worth the investment?\u0026rdquo;\nTool Findability The utility of the catalogues\u0026rsquo; special tools depends first on users\u0026rsquo; ability to find these tools. To understand whether or not users are likely to encounter the catalogues\u0026rsquo; special features in a brief session, the email survey asked participants to spend three minutes in free exploration of their assigned catalogue. After their three minutes had elapsed, they were asked check off a list of the special features they had encountered. In three minutes of use, most of the special features listed had been discovered by less than half of the participants.\n Tool Findability: Percent of email survey participants who located special features in 3 minutes of free exploration   FeatureCatalogue   AIC\nn=73 Getty\nn=75 NGA\nn=76 PMA\nn=84 TOTAL\nn=288     high-resolution zoomable images 67% 69% 61% 58% 68%   citation tool 40% 37% 24% 37% 37%   PDF downloads/print friendly versions 22% 23% 37% 36% 32%   360° rotating images 8%       interactive layered images 14%       tutorials 7%       glossary 59%       login/note function 18%       glossary and image pop-ups  48%      interactive maps  84%      object scale diagrams  45%      side-by-side comparative image viewer   16% 12% 14%   reader mode (side-by-side columns)   21%     downloadable images   51%     audio/video content   49%             digitized archival materials    64%    share function    14%    timeline    31%     Blank cells indicate that the catalogue does not feature that tool.\n    Tool Findability: Percent of email survey participants who located special features in 3 minutes of free exploration   FeatureCatalogue   AIC\nn=73 Getty\nn=75 NGA\nn=76 PMA\nn=84 TOTAL\nn=288     high-resolution zoomable images 67% 69% 61% 58% 68%   citation tool 40% 37% 24% 37% 37%   PDF downloads/print friendly versions 22% 23% 37% 36% 32%   360° rotating images 8%       interactive layered images 14%       tutorials 7%       glossary 59%       login/note function 18%       glossary and image pop-ups  48%      interactive maps  84%      object scale diagrams  45%      side-by-side comparative image viewer   16% 12% 14%   reader mode (side-by-side columns)   21%     downloadable images   51%     audio/video content   49%             digitized archival materials    64%    share function    14%    timeline    31%     Blank cells indicate that the catalogue does not feature that tool.\n      The findability of these special features is largely dependent on the unique design of each catalogue. The map feature of the Getty Roman Mosaics catalogue is especially prominent on the catalogue\u0026rsquo;s homepage, so it\u0026rsquo;s unsurprising that it received a high percentage of usage. The side-by-side image comparison viewers featured in the NGA and PMA\u0026rsquo;s catalogues, in contrast, require some digging to find. Across all catalogues, however, most participants did hone in on the zoomable images, which further reinforces our finding that images are of utmost important to the target audience.\nEmail survey participants might have found the catalogues\u0026rsquo; special features through their free exploration, but they were also directed later in the survey to search specifically for image viewing tools, citation tools, and pdf downloads/print-friendly versions of the catalogues \u0026ndash; three features common across the four catalogues. They then rated the difficulty of finding and using these tools. Once participants knew a tool existed, they generally didn\u0026rsquo;t find it hard to find. Participants in the focus groups, however, consistently said that if they had not been specifically directed to many of the tools in their homework exercise, they would not have found them in their own browsing. The challenge for the catalogues, therefore, is raising user awareness of these special features.\n         The PMA\u0026rsquo;s Johnson Collection catalogue and the NGA\u0026rsquo;s Dutch Paintings catalogue also tended to receive higher scores than the others on the findability and usability of its digital tools. Both catalogues group their tools together for easy access, which may be a reason for their appeal. (See Deeper Insights for a further breakdown of differences in the catalogues\u0026rsquo; tools.)\nTool Utility The catalogues special features \u0026ndash; such as citation tools, zoomable images, and pdf downloads \u0026ndash; tended to be received favorably by our study participants. When asked to give an overall rating of the catalogues\u0026rsquo; digital tools at the end of the survey, participants gave positive responses toward the \u0026ldquo;excellent\u0026rdquo; end of the scale.\n        Within each catalogue, however, certain tools were rated more useful than others. The highest-ranking tools are shown below. The digitized archival material featured in the PMA catalogue was immensely popular with participants, followed by images that could be viewed in high resolution as well as downloaded.\n        The PMA\u0026rsquo;s Johnson catalogue is the only catalogue in this study that includes archival materials (over 6,000 items) which are cross-referenced from its artwork entries. The archives were not mentioned frequently during our focus groups, but one participant commented that they loved how the PMA catalogue \u0026ldquo;broke down the siloes\u0026rdquo; between museum and archives, relieving scholars of the burden of having to search multiple databases.\nOf all the digital tools in the catalogues, focus group participants spent the most time discussing the image viewing features. Being able to view and manipulate images is of utmost importance to the catalogues\u0026rsquo; target audience:\n I think if you\u0026rsquo;re talking interactivity, anything that can help the scholar, the researcher understand the object better \u0026ndash; I love that.\n Participants\u0026rsquo; number one priority in image tools was high resolution images that could also be downloaded. They were pleased by the quality provided by most of the catalogues, but occasionally annoyed when an image couldn\u0026rsquo;t be downloaded or when they had to visit a separate page to download an image. Minute details are important to the target audience. One participant noted:\n If I want to share the way, for example, Matisse painted, I want to be able to see his brush strokes or um, if I want to show how a mosaic is made, I want to see the exact dimensions of the tessera or so on and so forth. So I was missing sometimes a scale bar.\n The Getty catalogue does include a scale for its mosaics, which users appreciated. They wished that the other catalogues would also find ways to represent dimensions of their works.\nThe more complex image viewing tools, such as the 360° views of sculptures and the layered images in the Matisse catalogue, were also appreciated, although by a somewhat smaller audience. A conservator noted that the x-ray and IR images were immensely helpful for his work and that there is never space for these images in print catalogues.\nThe NGA and PMA catalogues both incorporate image comparison tools, which were also praised by many users. One focus group participant noted that ability to compare preparatory drawings side-by-side with a finished work was extremely helpful to her as someone interested in artistic process. Of the two catalogues, the NGA\u0026rsquo;s tool was more popular because it allowed participants to choose which images they wanted to compare.\n","id":15,"length":1191,"title":"Which special digital features are most appreciated by catalogue users?","type":"page","url":"https://digpublishing.github.io/catalogues-study/functionality-and-design/features/"},{"content":"","id":16,"length":"","title":"Scholarly Content","type":"","url":""},{"content":"","id":17,"length":"","title":"What is the depth and breadth of a typical use session?","type":"","url":""},{"content":"","id":18,"length":"","title":"What kinds of content and information are most useful to users?","type":"","url":""},{"content":"","id":19,"length":"","title":"Do users have confidence in the catalogues’ scholarship?","type":"","url":""},{"content":"","id":20,"length":"","title":"What special value do digital catalogues hold for users?","type":"","url":""},{"content":"","id":21,"length":"","title":"What other possibilities could digital platforms explore to serve users?","type":"","url":""},{"content":"","id":22,"length":"","title":"Methods in Depth","type":"","url":""},{"content":"","id":23,"length":"","title":"Research Instruments","type":"","url":""},{"content":"","id":24,"length":"","title":"Credits","type":"","url":""}]
