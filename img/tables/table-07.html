      <td>
        <p>Referral sessions indicate catalogue users are finding links to the catalogue from other websites, including academic search engines, arts and culture blogs, or the websites of professional organizations. This type of traffic suggests the catalogues are accessible to the scholarly audiences they are intended to serve.</p>
        <p>Organic search sessions indicate users are arriving at the catalogues after conducting a search via Google or another search engine. This traffic may be important for reaching additional audiences beyond the catalogues' primary target groups. (For more information on discoverability, see <a href="/marketing-and-demographics/finding/">How are users finding the catalogues?</a>)</p>

        <p>Drilling deeper to discover the number of sessions or visitors that land on the catalogue's homepage, table of contents, or other pages of significance can help museums distinguish between visitors who are making use of the catalogue as a whole versus visitors with awareness of or interest in only limited pages. The web structure of the catalogue and its relationship to other pages on the museum website are also important considerations. (For more information on how web structure affects catalogue traffic, see <a href="/further-analyses/#the-unique-structure-of-the-nga-s-online-editions">Appendix A: Further Analyses â€” The Unique Structure of the NGA's Online Editions</a>)</p>

        <p>The length of time users spend in a catalogue is one measure of their engagement with the material. As an analytics metric, average session duration can be misleading due to outliers and the fact that Google records bounced sessions as having a duration of 0. The distribution of session duration gives a more complete picture of visitor engagement, or staff can focus on the percentage of sessions that last over 10 minutes (or an alternative target set by staff).</p>
