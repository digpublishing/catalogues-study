        <p>Depth of engagement is also a measure of usability, since visitors are unlikely to persist in using a digital catalogue if they cannot find what they are looking for.

        <p>Users who access the homepage and table of contents during a session are likely to encounter some key wayfinding signals that help them navigate the catalogue.</p>
        <p>Tracking the use of special tools in digital catalogues (such as downloads of PDF versions and use of citation tools or image viewing tools) requires experience in setting up analytics conversions and goals, which was beyond the scope of this study. Doing so, however, can give museums concrete data on how frequently these tools are used and if they contribute to deeper engagement.</p>
